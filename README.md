# Nirupam Demo Site

Lightweight demo site for personal projects. Contains a root homepage and a small blog page.

Pages
- `index.html` — root homepage
- `nirupam-/index.html` — blog landing page

Quick start (Windows PowerShell)
```powershell
cd "C:\Users\ASUS\Downloads\demo"
Start-Process index.html
```

What I changed
- Cleaned up duplicated/concatenated HTML in both pages and fixed encoding artifacts.
- Fixed syntax errors in `style/main.css` and added small layout + responsive improvements.

If you'd like additional styling, fonts, or deployment to GitHub Pages, tell me which you'd prefer and I'll set it up.
